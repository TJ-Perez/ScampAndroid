# Scamp
This game is a short platformer I built to learn the Unity Engine

This version is an apk for Android 8.1

*All Unity Engine work and programming done by TJ Perez*

<h2>How to Play:</h2>

1. Download the apk to your Android phone (it'll be called ScampAndroid0XX)

2. Install the apk as you normally would

3. Have fun!
